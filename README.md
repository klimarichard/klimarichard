### About me

I am a junior programmer currently working as a database administrator in Prague. I am and enthusiast for stats of all kind, but mainly the sport ones. I created a database of all player and goalie stats of the top men's Czech floorball league from its start in 1994 upto today which I now manage to stay up to date.

I am also a musician, composer and sound engineer. I play in a multi-instrumental duo with my dad, feel free to check out our web and YouTube channel.
