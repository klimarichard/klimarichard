### About me

I am a junior programmer currently studying computer science in Prague. My main fields of study are mathematical linguistics and natural language processing. I am currently working on my bachelor thesis that concerns comma completion into Czech sentences.

I am also a musician, composer and sound engineer. I play in a multi-instrumental duo with my dad, feel free to check out our web and YouTube channel.
